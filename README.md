# 🌍 BetterFriend Translations

Help make BetterFriend accessible to everyone by contributing translations! 💜

## How It Works

1. Fork this repository

2. Create a new branch for your language or changes

3. Add your translation file:

   - Use `en.js` as a template
   - Rename it using the [2-letter ISO language code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes):
     - `en.js` (English)
     - `pt.js` (Portuguese)
     - `es.js` (Spanish)
     - etc.

4. Translate all values while keeping the keys unchanged

5. Run validator.js to ensure everything is correct

6. Open a Pull Request (PR)

7. Wait for review and approval 🚀

## ⚠️ Important Guidelines

- Do not change the keys, only translate the values

- Keep translations clear and natural, not literal when it sounds wrong

- Make sure your file passes `validator.js` before submitting

- One language per PR (keeps reviews simple)
